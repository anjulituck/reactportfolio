        Hello â€” My name is Anjuli Garcia. I am an aspiring software developer, with a preference in front-end development and design, and a knack for helping purpose-driven businesses. I would like to dedicate my skills to companies who have a passion for helping people and the planet. I've combine my passions for social impact, code and creativity into my current freelance hobby, Studio Junk. I believe championing impact driven brands will level up our communities and our planet. In the meantime, I enjoy going to the movies, hanging with my dog Elton John, and eating good ole saucy pizza.
        If my aspirations and skills resonate with you, feel free to contact me. I hope you liked the preview!
